pyVistA
=======

A Python package for invoking VistA RPCs through the new style RPC Broker and RPMS RPCs through the CIA Broker. Invocation can be from self-contained Python clients or web-hosted (WSGI) services. 

By way of comparison, this provides for Python some of what MDWS provides for C#, Vistalink/OVID provides for Java and EWD provides for MUMPS.
